<a name="we-care-about-ease-of-use" class="anchor" href="#we-care-about-ease-of-use"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>We care about ease of use.</h3>

<p>The main idea of cppkit is that we are willing to sacrifice a little performance to gain usability. The end result will be a library that won't work for those who need the utmost performance, but will be a joy to use for everyone else. cppkit is an opinionated library that won't be right for everyone, and we think that's perfectly OK.</p>

<h3><a name="the-cppkit-ecosystem" class="anchor" href="#the-cppkit-ecosystem"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>cppkit will be offensive to some.</h3>

<p>First and foremost, we try to be pragmatic. Because of this, cppkit will sometimes do unpopular things:</p>
<br />
<pre>
  ck_string v1 = "10.5";
  ck_string v2 = "10.5";
  ck_string sum = ck_string::from_double( v1.to_double() + v2.to_double() );
  
  // the cppkit string class has ALL of the functions of std::string, plus a bunch more that are totally useful.
  
  ck_string formatted = ck_string::format( "Oh Noes! A string class! With a format() member! The horror... The sum is %s.", sum.c_str() );

  vector&lt;ck_string&gt; parts = formatted.split( "horror" );
</pre>
<p>If this code makes you want to gag, that is OK. But you might not want to see any more.</p>
<br />
<p>We think the actor model is pretty great combined with C++11 std::future.</p>
<pre>
class adder_actor : public ck_actor<std::pair<int,int>,int>
{
public:
    virtual int process( const std::pair<int,int>& cmd ) override
    {
        return cmd.first + cmd.second;
    }
};

void ck_actor_test::test_adder()
{
    adder_actor a;
    a.start();
    future<int> result = a.post( make_pair<int,int>( 21, 21 ) );
    result.wait();
    UT_ASSERT( result.get() == 42 );
    a.stop();
}
</pre>
<br />
<p>We propose that there should be room in the world for a bit of the Ruby on Rails "Convention over Configuration" within C++. To that end, we include a CMake based build ecosystem. With our build system, a new library can be defined like so:</p>
<pre>
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)
project(hyper)

set(SOURCES source/hyper_exception.cpp
            source/hyper_utils.cpp
            source/uri.cpp
            source/url.cpp
            source/client_request.cpp
            source/client_response.cpp
            source/server_request.cpp
            source/server_response.cpp
            source/methods.cpp)

set(COMMON_LIBS cppkit)

include(../devel_artifacts/build/base_lib.cmake NO_POLICY_SCOPE)
</pre>
<p>The above cmake configuration file defines a project called "hyper" that is dependant on cppkit.</p>
<ul>
<li>cppkit (and downstream libraries) will install their headers and libraries to a directory at the same level as the cppkit project called "devel_artifacts".</li>
<li>Headers for each library will go into their own subdirectory under "devel_artifacts/include". For example, a downstream library called "foo" would put it's headers in "devel_artifacts/include/foo".</li>
<li>Libraries for all downstream projects will install into "devel_artifacts/lib".</li>
<li>cppkit will install build support files into "devel_artifacts/build". Downstream projects should only have to define a few variables and then include the appropriate build support cmake file to get all of the default ecosystem behaviour.</li>
<li>By using the common build support files downstream libraries will automatically have "devel_artifacts/include" added to their compilers include search path. They will also have "devel_artifacts/lib" added to their library search path. Projects should include the headers of other projects like this: #include "cppkit/ck_dynamic_library.h"</li>
<li>Downstream libraries should define their own C++ namespace, and (unless they have VERY good reason not to) confine all of their symbols to their own namespace.</li>
</ul>
